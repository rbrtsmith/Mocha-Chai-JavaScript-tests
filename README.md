# Mocha-Chai-JavaScript-tests

Me learning some TDD, using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) assertion library.
I am also using [blanket.js](http://blanketjs.org/) a JavaScript code coverage library.

The tests cover a few basic functions, `Sanitize()`, `Fibonacci()`, and `doubleAll()` which are found at `src/index.js`.

There's also a bunch of Crockford questions found in `src/crock-solutions.js`.

All the tests are found in `test/test.js`.
